## 🚀 Phase 1 Deliverables (Previously Completed)

### 1. Database Hardening ✅
**File**: `database/migrations/2025_10_22_052025_add_database_hardening_indexes_and_constraints.php`

- **Composite Indexes**:
  - `idx_products_company_sku` - Fast product lookups
  - `idx_customers_company_phone` - Unique customer identification
  - `idx_stock_movements_ledger` - Optimized movement queries
  - `idx_sale_orders_reporting` - Report performance
  - And 4 more strategic indexes

- **Foreign Key Constraints**:
  - CASCADE on company deletion (data cleanup)
  - RESTRICT on customer/product deletion (data integrity)
  - SET NULL on tier deletion (graceful handling)

### 2. Atomic InventoryService ✅
**File**: `app/Services/InventoryService.php` (210 lines)

**Key Features**:

- Append-only ledger (complete audit trail)
- Bulk adjustment support
- Filtered movement history
- Low stock & out-of-stock detection

**Usage**:
```php
$inventoryService->adjust(
    product: $product,
    qtyDelta: -10,  // Deduct 10 units
    refType: 'SALE',
    refId: 'SO-202510-0001',
    notes: 'Sold to customer'
);
```

  Admin Approves → Payment "Received"
```

**Features**:
- File upload (JPG, PNG, PDF, max 5MB)
- Storage: `storage/app/public/slips/{company}/{tx}/`

## 🎓 Key Learnings & Best Practices Applied

1. **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic separated from controllers
2. **Repository Pattern** (implicit): Models handle data access
3. **Middleware Stacking**: Auth → Tenant → RBAC → Rate Limit
4. **Test-Driven Development**: Tests guide architecture
5. **Documentation-First**: Clear docs = fewer questions
6. **Security by Default**: RBAC, rate limiting, CORS from day 1
7. **Database Optimization**: Indexes before scale issues
8. **Atomic Operations**: Transactions + locking = data integrity
